                <h2>What is Golf?</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Golf is a sport in which players use clubs to hit a small ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible. The game is typically played on an outdoor course that consists of 18 holes, although there are also 9-hole courses. Each hole has a tee box, fairway, and a green with a hole (often called a cup) where the ball is aimed.</p>
                <p>The objective is to complete the course with the fewest strokes. Golf can be played individually or in teams, and it's known for its emphasis on skill, precision, and etiquette. The game has various formats, including stroke play and match play, and is enjoyed recreationally and competitively around the world.</p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Golf originated in 15th-century Scotland, with the earliest mention in 1457 when it was banned to promote archery. By the late 16th century, it gained popularity among the nobility, leading to the formation of the Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers in 1744.</p>
                <p>In the 19th century, golf spread to England and the U.S., with the first American club founded in 1888. The Open Championship began in 1860, further boosting the sport's popularity. Golf grew significantly in the 20th century, establishing major tournaments like the Masters and PGA Championship, and today it is a global sport enjoyed by millions.</p>

                <h2>When to Play</h2>
                <p>The best season to play golf is Fall because the weather is perfect for a long round. In the winter it is too cold, in the summer it can be too hot, and Spring it rains too much so courses can be in bad shape.</p>
                <p>Even though Fall is the best season to play it doesn't mean that if there is good weather during any of the other seasons that you shouldn't take the opportunity to go out and play.</p>
